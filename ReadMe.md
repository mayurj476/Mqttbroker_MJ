# Lightweight Custom MQTT Broker in C++

This project is a simple yet effective MQTT Broker implemented in C++. It supports essential MQTT features such as:

- Client connection handling using TCP sockets
- Topic-based subscriptions
- Multithreaded client handling
- Basic MQTT v3 message parsing (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, etc.)
- Logs with custom log levels

## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

I wanted to deeply understand how MQTT protocol works under the hood. Instead of just using existing brokers, I created my own MQTT server from scratch to get hands-on with:

- Low-level socket programming
- MQTT packet structure
- Multithreaded design
- Subscription management

## ðŸ”§ Features

| Feature               | Status |
|-----------------------|--------|
| TCP Client Handling   | âœ…     |
| SUBSCRIBE Support     | âœ…     |
| PUBLISH Message Flow  | âœ…     |
| Threaded Connections  | âœ…     |
| Graceful Disconnection| âœ…     |



##  Upcoming Features
- Wildcard topic matching (`+` and `#`)
- observer patern implementation


##  Tested With

- `mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub` CLI tools
- Custom client connections over `localhost`

example usage:
Test using :mosqito sub and pub 

mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1884 -t "test" -m "hello again"

// -v to keep alive connection 
mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1884 -t "test" -v
